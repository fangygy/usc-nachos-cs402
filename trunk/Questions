? when stop to take ticket, how to break

what state is the clerk when they are first init? and after one customer leave? if not busy, then how should customer signal them?

if clerk find customer in line, will signal him. but not sub line size. customer sub line size.

clerk is busy as long as there is someone in line. only if there is no one in line. and init as busy, so clerk have to check customer first.


deadlock: tickettaker
79:  lTicketTaken->Acquire();

sStartMovie->V() many times?
