1. Requirements: 
Part1: 
     To achieve synchronization among threads by implementing semaphores(which is already provided), locks, and condition variables. 
Part2: 
     Simulates a movie theater with the following types of people: 
Customer - Someone who has come to watch a movie - and perhaps buy some food 
TicketClerk - TicketClerks sell movie tickets to Customers. 
ConcessionClerk - ConcessionClerks sell food to Customers. 
TicketTaker - TicketTakers take movie tickets that Customers have purchased from a TicketClerk, and they also remind the Customer the number of the theater that their movie is being shown in. 
MovieTechnician - MovieTechnicians start and stop movies in each theater . 
Manager - Managers keep the theater running by making sure the various employees are doing their job. Managers also collect money from cash registers every so often.
2. Assumptions: 
Customer:
a. customers get into the movie theater with their group and ticketbuyers will interact with clerk after entering theater.
b. if no clerks on service, customers cannot find a line and they need to wait in the lobby until the manager signal them
c. if clerk is break, customers in the same line have to go back to re-line.
d. customers tell ticketbuyer what food they want in one response.
 
3. Design: 
Customer of TicketBuyer:
a. enter theater with group
b. buy tickets
    find the shortest line and then get in line. if not find, wait in the lobby and set noClerk variables until the manager broadcast them.
    if ticketClerk is busy then wait for ticketClerk signal, else go to signal free ticketClerk.
    if ticketClerk is on break then go back find line, else interact with ticketClerk.
    interact: tell clerk tickets sum, wait for money amount, and then pay money, wait to get tickets back, finish and leave.
c. proceed with group after getting tickets
    wait customers get gather, and broadcast customers.
d. count food requests
    ticketbuyer ask customer for food, and then customer response
e. buy food
    find line.
    if concession clerk is busy then wait for clerk signal, else go to signal free clerk.
    if concession clerk is on break then go back find line, else interact with clerk.
    interact: tell clerk popcorn sum and soda sum, wait for acknowledgement and amount, and then pay money, wait to get food back, finish and leave.
f. proceed with group after getting food
g. check tickets
    find line.
    if ticket taker is busy then wait for clerk signal, else go to signal free clerk.
    if ticket taker is on break then go back find line, else interact with clerk.
    if ticket taker stops taking tickets, go to lobby and wait manager to broadcast.
    then interact with ticket taker, give ticket receipt.
    if ticket taker stop taking ticket for theater is full, go to lobby and wait for broadcast.
    else wait ticket taker to allow to get into room.
h. proceed with group after allowed into theater room
i. arrange seats
j. sit in the theater room
k. proceed with group after movie over
l. go bathroom or wait in lobby
m. proceed with group after bathroom
n. leave theater

Customer of regular:
a. enter theater with group
b. proceed with group after getting tickets
c. requests for food
d. proceed with group after getting food
e. proceed with group after allowed into theater room
f. sit in the theater room
g. proceed with group after movie over
h. go bathroom or wait in lobby
i. proceed with group after bathroom
j. leave theater

Manager: do while, and yield every loop
a. check and break clerk (TicketClerk, ConcessionClerk, TicketTaker)
b. start movie and stop ticket taken
c. start ticket taken
d. collect money after all customers leave

    if on break, wait for manager signal
    if customer on waiting line, ask customer to proceed,
    then wait customer to signal,
    get tickets sum from customer,
    if too much tickets, stop taking tickets. first to ask the customer on service to wait on lobby, and broadcast every one in line to go lobby.
    else allow customer to in, and not to enforce seats number.
b. stop working if manager asks
c. stop checking if no more place

MovieTechnician:
a. start movie
    wait Manager to signal, then check the seated and then start movie.
b. check if customer all seated

Manager:
a. check and break clerk (TicketClerk, ConcessionClerk, TicketTaker)

	##TEST CASE 6##
	    Customer groups always move together through the theater. This requires explicit synchronization that you implement.

6. Discussions:

    We use lock, semaphore, and condition variable function in part 1 to implentment part 2 movie theater simulation. In clerk and customer functions, there are monitors which include lock,condition variable, and monitor variable to ensure no race condition happened among customers and clerks. 
Locks in functions are desinged to guarantee the accuracy of variable in critcal setion that is : variables will not be read and written at the same time.
For example, each time there is only one head customer can get in line or arrange seats for their group members. And condition variables are design to guarantee particular procedure will occur in order, such as clerk and customer interaction. Moreover,our simulation output results match the movie theater requirements and the program can run successfully with very little chance of crash and stuck.

7. Miscellaneous: 
        
	-Programming
	    There are still competions between the threads, I mess it up after modifing the break rules, I followed the output, the problem should be in the part of ticket taker. But hard to figure out. If all the clerk can get break, the program can not process well. So I only let the ticket clerk to be able to get break. I would like to figure it out, but time is over.
    -Compiling
        Nothing.
   	-Testing & Debugging
        Testing costs a lot time, and I have to figure out an efficiency way to print debug info and for locating the problems.
        So I used some shell command for test output instead of search by hand. but still hard to verify the result.
